## **Overview**

### **The Challenge**

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly.

## **My Process**

### **Built With**

- **HTML5**: Semantic HTML structure for accessibility.
- **SCSS (Sass)**: For more organized and maintainable CSS. Includes variables, mixins, and nested rules.
- **JavaScript**: Handles form validation for email input and provides dynamic error/success messages.
- **Flexbox**: Used to create a flexible layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Mobile-First Design**: The design starts for mobile screens and adapts to larger screens using media queries.
- **Google Fonts**: Used "Josefin Sans" for typography.

### **What I Learned**

- **SCSS Nesting**: I learned how to organize styles better by utilizing SCSSâ€™s feature of nesting rules. This makes my CSS more readable and easier to maintain.
  
  Example of SCSS nesting:
  ```scss
  .image-container {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
  
    img {
      &.hero-desktop {
        display: none;
      }
  
      &.hero-mobile {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Form Validation with JavaScript**: I worked with JavaScript to handle form submission, display error messages for invalid email addresses, and show success messages when the form is successfully submitted.

  Example of form validation:
  ```js
  const submitButton = document.getElementById('submit');
  const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
  const errorMessage = document.querySelector('.text-error');

  submitButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
    if (!emailInput.value || !validateEmail(emailInput.value)) {
      errorMessage.textContent = "Please provide a valid email address.";
    } else {
      errorMessage.textContent = '';
      alert("Email submitted successfully!");
    }
  });

  function validateEmail(email) {
    const regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/;
    return regex.test(email);
  }
  ```

### **Continued Development**

- **Refining Accessibility**: In future projects, I plan to make sure all interactive elements are fully accessible, including adding `aria` attributes where needed.
  
- **Enhanced Email Validation**: I would like to further enhance the email validation to check for edge cases and improve user experience with real-time validation.
